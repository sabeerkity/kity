â—‰ I'm a Civil Engineer and a 'forever' student, in updating latest technological development in the industry.

â—‰ Also I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast and completed some basic certificatioins and have passion in explioting in loopholes   ðŸ˜‚ , just kidding.

â—‰ Academic Background - B.E. Civil Engineering in Anna University , Madurai.

â—‰ And I also have another rare talent that everyone find useless , I'm a cinephile.
  I have completed around 31 Series and still counting on and watched 1000's of movies even before my Twenties , which acts as a Stress Buster for me.
